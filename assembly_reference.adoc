= How siteless works
:context: reference

Siteless is a opininated view of asciidoc writing and publishing, this description is not necessary to use it.

Siteless assumes a web server is running an a browser is connected to that web server.
For each request:

. Siteless renders the index.html page.
. That page references `asciidoctor.js` which enables asciidoc to html conversion.
. index.html contains a reference to index.adoc.
. index.html can interpret parameters referencing other adoc files.
. asciidoctor parses the referenced adoc file.
. asciidoctor requests any included files (ie supports assemblies)
