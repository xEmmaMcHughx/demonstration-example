included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='my-concept-module-a']
// * Title: = My concept module A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id='concept-explanation-{context}']
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= The siteless template
//In the title of concept modules, include nouns or noun phrases that are used in the body text. This helps readers and search engines find the information quickly.
//Do not start the title of concept modules with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

Siteless is a template git repo that you clone/fork/copy and edit in order to produce a web site.
It does not provide editing tools, a user interface or the typical feature set of a framework, CMS, or word processor.
It does allow you to customize and scale your content, while making it easy to get going fast.
